# 2026

### Great posts | articles | vids read/watched

Like Michael Fogus with his annual "Best Things and Stuff" posts, I’ve taken the
time to jot down the reads, watches, and listens that sparked curiosity, joy,
and new rabbit holes for me this year. This isn’t an exhaustive or canonical
list—just a personal highlight reel of content that broadened my horizons, made
me nod in quiet agreement, or sent me off to explore strange new corners of
knowledge.

Here are some of the most memorable posts, articles, and videos that shaped my 2026.
