# 2026

> Inspired by Michael Fogus’s [The Best Things and Stuff of
> 2025](https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2025.html),
> I figured I’d toss together a quick list of the stuff I read, watched, or
> listened to this year that was genuinely cool or just sent me down random
> rabbit holes. This definitely isn’t some official list. Just a handful of
> things that made my year a bit more interesting, made me nod and smile, or had
> me googling for hours. Here’s a little roundup of the posts, articles, and
> videos that stuck with me in 2026.
