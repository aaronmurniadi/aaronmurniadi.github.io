I’ve decided to transition my blog from GitHub Pages to Bearblog!

## Why the Change?

While GitHub Pages served me well, it had its drawbacks and too compilcated for its own good. Bearblog provides a more straightforward, ad-free environment that allows me to concentrate on my writing. It’s lightweight, quick, and prioritizes privacy, which were crucial in my choice (robots.txt ftw!).

## The Migration Journey

The transition was quite simple. I exported my Markdown posts and images from GitHub Pages and then uploaded them to Bearblog. The platform's user-friendly interface made it easy to manage my posts, and I was able to customize the design to fit my aesthetic.

## What’s Ahead?

With Bearblog, I’m looking forward to writing more often. The platform's simplicity makes blogging more accessible and enjoyable, enabling me to focus on producing content rather than dealing with technical aspects.
