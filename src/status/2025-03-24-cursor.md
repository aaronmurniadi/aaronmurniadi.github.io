Our company recently launched an AI adoption campaign. As part of this, the QA team has been given a 14-day Pro trial of Cursor, a VS Code fork with built-in AI. We're currently testing it to see if it enhances our productivity. If it proves useful, the company will subscribe us to the Pro tier to support our work.
