The Cursor trial’s been going pretty well for QA, especially for Software Engineers working on automation. Right now, it’s opt-in only, and we’re rolling it out to folks who’ve been using it productively over the last couple of weeks. I’m excited because I got access after requesting it and giving a solid reason for how I’d use it.
