# Typst Collection

Welcome to my collection of documents created with [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern markup-based typesetting system designed as a modern alternative to LaTeX. Typst offers a clean and expressive syntax, making it easier to write and maintain documents while still producing professional-quality PDFs for everything from academic papers to creative layouts. This gallery features a variety of examples, each highlighting different features and strengths of Typst compared to traditional LaTeX workflows.

Here you'll find documents, templates, and experiments that demonstrate Typst's powerful typesetting capabilities. Each example is available both as a compiled PDF and with access to the original source code for learning and reference.

For every document in this collection, you can view and download the final PDF output, as well as explore the `.typ` source code to see how it was created. Feel free to browse, get inspired, and use these examples as a starting point for your own Typst projects!
