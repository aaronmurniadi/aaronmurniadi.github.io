Managing Python projects often involves juggling multiple dependencies and Python versions. Virtual environments are a lifesaver, allowing you to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts. While Python's `venv` module is excellent, creating and activating environments can be a bit repetitive. To streamline this process, I've created a simple Bash function called `ve()` that simplifies virtual environment management:

```shell
ve() {
    local py="${1:-python3}"
    local venv="${2:-.venv}"
    local venv_path="./${venv}"

    local activate_script="${venv_path}/bin/activate"

    if [[ -n "$VIRTUAL_ENV" ]]; then
        echo "Already in a virtual environment: $VIRTUAL_ENV"
        return 0
    fi

    if [[ ! -d "$venv_path" ]]; then
        echo "Creating virtual environment: $venv_path"
        "$py" -m venv "$venv_path" --system-site-packages || return 1

        echo "export PYTHON=$py" >> "$activate_script"

        echo "Upgrading pip in new virtual environment..."
        source "$activate_script"
        "$py" -m pip install --upgrade pip || return 1
        deactivate # Deactivate to avoid confusion
        echo "Virtual environment created and pip upgraded."

    else
        echo "Activating existing virtual environment: $venv_path"
    fi

    source "$activate_script" || return 1
    echo "Virtual environment activated."
}
```

The function first checks if a virtual environment is already active by looking for the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable. If we're in a virtual environment already, the script will exit gracefully.

If we are not in a virtual environment AND there's no `.venv` folder found in the current directory, it will create a new virtual environment and then activates the environment.

Finally, it upgrades pip within the new virtual environment to ensure you have the latest version.

You can add this function to your shell configuration like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent shell configuration file. This will make the `ve()` function available in your terminal.
