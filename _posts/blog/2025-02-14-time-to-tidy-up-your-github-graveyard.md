So, I logged in into my GitHub account today and saw: 71 repositories! That is all the projects I've started, forks I've looked into, and then just abandoned. Let's be real; no way am I really keeping track of that many projects. Most of them are just remnants of things I was interested in for a short time.

I forked/created them, tinkering a bit, and then... nothing. They just lingered, collecting digital dust and taking up space on my GitHub profile.

I figured it was well past time to clean up this repository graveyard. My plan was so simple but totally effective: go through each repository one by one, see what's in there, and make a choice â€“ keep, archive, or remove.

It's not just about making my profile look cleaner. It's also about
saving resources. So, even though space taken may not be a lot, fewer repositories could sorta accelerate things and ease GitHub's servers somewhat, right, right...? 

Alright, maybe that's a stretch, but it still feels nice to do one's part, however small.
