I recently purged a significant chunk of my academic past, specifically from my philosophy studies between 2018 and 2022. Stacks of books, notebooks filled with scribbled arguments, and printed papers that once felt indispensable—all of them are now gone. What once represented growth, discipline, and identity has now become relics, tucked away in memories rather than shelves.

Letting go wasn't purely about clearing physical space. It was about confronting the weight of attachment. These materials were tied not only to knowledge but also to a version of myself that no longer feels present. I realized that holding onto them was less about their practical use and more about my hesitation to move on.

This act of purging mirrored another recent decision: deleting 48 GitHub repositories. Each repository was its own little world—projects, experiments, unfinished ideas—that I had once poured hours into. Some represented early learning, others abandoned ambitions. Deleting them felt oddly similar to tossing out philosophy notes: both were reminders of effort, identity, and growth, but also anchors to a version of myself I've outgrown.

There's a strange cocktail of emotions in this process. Nostalgia mixes with grief, but also with relief. I'm acknowledging the past, with all its weight and meaning, while affirming that the present matters more. These gestures are less about destruction and more about creating space.

Feelings feels.
Pasts presents.

To move forward, I must first allow the past to rest. It's not about erasing, but about choosing what I carry with me. And while it wasn't easy, it was necessary. The past did its job. The present is calling.

So, I move on.
