I recently purged a significant chunk of my academic past, specifically related to my philosophy studies from 2018-2022. This included discarding numerous books, notebooks, and papers, all of which had become relics of a previous chapter. 

This act mirrors my recent deletion of 48 GitHub repositories.  It's a strange mix of emotions, acknowledging the past while firmly stepping into the present.  While it wasn't easy, it felt necessary, and I'm ready to move forward.

Feelings feels.

Pasts presents.

But, it must be done and I'll move on.
