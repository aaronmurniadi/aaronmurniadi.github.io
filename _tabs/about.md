# Hi I'm Aaron Purnomo Murniadi

I'm a [QA Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmurniadi) at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co/en-sg) with a passion for technology, coding, and open-source software. My background includes four years of studying philosophy (though I didn't finish the degree), which has profoundly shaped my thinking and continues to influence my work and writing.

This blog serves as a platform for me to share my ideas, projects, and reflectionsâ€”covering everything from technical insights to philosophical musings.
