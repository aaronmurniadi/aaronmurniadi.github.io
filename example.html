    <h1>Time to tidy up your GitHub graveyard!</h1>

    <p>So, I logged in into my GitHub account today and saw: 71 repositories!</p>
    <p>All the projects I've started, forks I've looked into, and then just abandoned. Let's be real; no way am I really keeping track of that many projects. Most of them are just remnants of things I was interested in for a short time.</p>
    <p>I forked/created them, tinkering a bit, and then... nothing. They just lingered, collecting digital dust and taking up space on my GitHub profile.</p>
    <p>I figured it was well past time to clean up this repository graveyard. My plan was so simple but totally effective: go through each repository one by one, see what's in there, and make a choice – keep, archive, or remove.</p>
    <p>It's not just about making my profile look cleaner. It's also about saving resources. So, even though space taken may not be a lot, fewer repositories could sorta accelerate things and ease GitHub's servers somewhat, right, right...?</p>
    <p>Alright, maybe that's a stretch, but it still feels nice to do one's part, however small.</p>
