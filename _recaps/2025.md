# 2025 Recap

> Inspired by Michael Fogus’s [The Best Things and Stuff of
> 2025](https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2025.html),
> I figured I’d toss together a quick list of the stuff I read, watched, or
> listened to this year that was genuinely cool or just sent me down random
> rabbit holes. This definitely isn’t some official list. Just a handful of
> things that made my year a bit more interesting, made me nod and smile, or had
> me googling for hours. Here’s a little roundup of the posts, articles, and
> videos that stuck with me in 2026.

## Favorite websites discovered

- [Michael Fogus’s The Best Things and Stuff of
  2025](https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2025.html).
  The post that inspired this page.

- [explore.marginalia.nu](https://explore.marginalia.nu/view). Great website for
  discovering new sites. Most of the sites on this page were discovered there.

- [artvee.com](https://artvee.com/). Nice website to browse for paintings.

## Favorite YouTube channel discovered

- [kallmekris](https://www.youtube.com/@kallmekris). I stumbled upon her channel
  this year, and it quickly became one of my favorites. Her "Unsolved Cases"
  series especially stood out. She's such a good storyteller, effortlessly
  blending her comedic skits with more serious and endlessly fascinating
  content.

## Favorite non-technical books read

- [The Electric State, a Graphic Novel by Simon
  Stålenhag](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39406558-the-electric-state).
  The original book (pre-Netflix adaptation) was given to me as a birthday
  present by my best friend. I'm so lucky to have a copy without the Netflix
  logo slapped on the cover. The movie adaptation of this book was denounced by
  its author as non-canon. Probably the most embarrassing thing that can happen
  to a movie adaptation. Anyway, the drawings and story are equally mesmerizing.

## Favorite musicians / albums discovered

## Favorite show or series

- [3 Body Problem](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)>).
  I tried to read the book but is too dry for me. I've enjoyed the 1st season.
  Looking forward for the next season!

## Favorite movies discovered

## Favorite podcasts

- [SciShow Tangents Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/scishowtangents) ends
  this year. It's a really informative podcast with hilarious hosts. I also
  appreciate that they eventually make the Patreon-only episodes available to
  everyone. Such a thoughtful move.

## Favorite games discovered

- [Delta Force Mobile (Garena)](https://deltaforce.garena.com/). Finally, a
  Battle Field like game that I can play on mobile. I've been playing this the
  whole year along with Mobile Legends.

## Programming languages used for work-related projects

- [Java](https://www.java.com/). Still my most used programming language used
  for QA automation. I'm transitioning to dev though, and our tech stack mainly
  used:

- [Go](https://go.dev/). This will be my most used programming language as a
  Developer.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/). Mainly used for CI/CD of our QA automation
  projects.
