        <p>I’ve decided to transition my blog from GitHub Pages to Bearblog!</p>
<h2 id="why-the-change">Why the Change?</h2>
<p>While GitHub Pages served me well, it had its drawbacks and too compilcated for its own good. Bearblog provides a more straightforward, ad-free environment that allows me to concentrate on my writing. It’s lightweight, quick, and prioritizes privacy, which were crucial in my choice (robots.txt ftw!).</p>
<h2 id="the-migration-journey">The Migration Journey</h2>
<p>The transition was quite simple. I exported my Markdown posts and images from GitHub Pages and then uploaded them to Bearblog. The platform&rsquo;s user-friendly interface made it easy to manage my posts, and I was able to customize the design to fit my aesthetic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-ahead">What’s Ahead?</h2>
<p>With Bearblog, I’m looking forward to writing more often. The platform&rsquo;s simplicity makes blogging more accessible and enjoyable, enabling me to focus on producing content rather than dealing with technical aspects.</p>
