        <p>So, I logged in into my GitHub account today and saw: 71 repositories! That is all the projects I&rsquo;ve started, forks I&rsquo;ve looked into, and then just abandoned. Let&rsquo;s be real; no way am I really keeping track of that many projects. Most of them are just remnants of things I was interested in for a short time.</p>
<p>I forked/created them, tinkering a bit, and then&hellip; nothing. They just lingered, collecting digital dust and taking up space on my GitHub profile.</p>
<p>I figured it was well past time to clean up this repository graveyard. My plan was so simple but totally effective: go through each repository one by one, see what&rsquo;s in there, and make a choice – keep, archive, or remove.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about making my profile look cleaner. It&rsquo;s also about<br />
saving resources. So, even though space taken may not be a lot, fewer repositories could sorta accelerate things and ease GitHub&rsquo;s servers somewhat, right, right&hellip;? </p>
<p>Alright, maybe that&rsquo;s a stretch, but it still feels nice to do one&rsquo;s part, however small.</p>
