# My Static Blog Generator

A vibe-coded Python-based static blog generator with real-time watch.

## Development

To get started, install the project and its development dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
$ uv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Then you can run the generator:
```bash
$ generate
```
